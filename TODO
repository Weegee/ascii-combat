0.3.0
=====
[ ] Implement EXP

  To progress in ASCII Combat, the player has to gain experience points, EXP.
  EXP are needed if you want to upgrade your weapons or your ship, and
  eventually, they will result - together with other factors - in your personal
  score.

  [ ] Replace score values with EXP values
  [ ] Write an algorithm which converts EXP and other factors to a highscore

[ ] Implement armour

  Armour is actually the ship's shield which helps to reduce the amount of
  damage your ship takes. It prevents the immediate destruction of the ship
  itself.

[ ] Implement items

  Items are entities which randomly spawn on the playing field and quickly
  disappear if the player doesn't pick them up. Items are either weapons or
  artifacts. Whilst weapons will only spawn if the player doesn't already own
  the same type of weapon, artifacts always spawn during the whole game.

  There will be three different weapon types: Some kind of machine gun, a laser
  and a special weapon which is able to do all the craziest things. They all
  will be very weak when the player gets them, but their power will vastly
  improve as the player gains more EXP and thus is able to upgrade his weapons.
  Also, the way the weapons shoot their ammunition will change if they are
  upgraded, more details will be added later on.

  Artifacts only have two types: Either they are used immediately when the
  player picks them up or the player is able to store them in his inventory, so
  he is able to use them later on. Artifacts help (or harm) the player in
  different ways - again, more details will be added later.

[ ] Implement an inventory

  The player should always be able to know which items he has collected and
  what properties they have. For this reason, a fullscreen window/menu should be
  shown which displays all items and their features.

  [ ] Create a new w_inv with information about weapons and items

0.4.0
=====
[ ] Implement stages

  Stages are what one might call levels. Every stage is a part of the game, in
  which the player is able to gain EXP. At the end of every stage there is a
  so-called stage boss, which the player has to defeat in order to continue
  (or to quit) the game. The difficulty of the game increases from stage to
  stage (enemies have more health points, deal more damage and so on).

  [ ] Write formulas for ...

    [ ] Score calculation
    [ ] Gradual player stats improvement
    [ ] Decreasing item spawn probability

0.5.0 - 1.0.0
=============
Add content (obstacles, enemies, ...). More details will be added later on.
