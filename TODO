0.3.0
=====
[X] Implement EXP

  To progress in ASCII Combat, the player has to gain experience points, EXP.
  EXP are needed if you want to upgrade your weapons or your ship, and
  eventually, they will result - together with other factors - in your personal
  score.

[X] Implement armour

  Armour is actually the ship's shield which helps to reduce the amount of
  damage your ship takes. It prevents the immediate destruction of the ship
  itself.

[X] Implement an inventory

  The player should always be able to know which items he has collected and
  what properties they have. For this reason, a fullscreen window/menu should be
  shown which displays all items and their features.

  [X] Create a new w_inv with information about weapons and items

[X] Implement stages

  Stages are what one might call levels. Every stage is a part of the game, in
  which the player is able to gain EXP. At the end of every stage there is a
  so-called stage boss, which the player has to defeat in order to continue
  (or to quit) the game. The difficulty of the game increases from stage to
  stage (enemies have more health points, deal more damage and so on).
